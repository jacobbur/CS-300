# CS-300

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
In the projects for this course, ABCU has requested a means for sorting course information. This includes the most effective means to sort the available courses, as well as print the course information and any prerequisites necessary for those courses. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
For these projects, we first took a few weeks to learn about different sorting methods, vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. In project one, we took each of the three methods and broke them down into pseudocode, and then completed a run-time and memory analysis. Having completed this, it was pretty easy to see that using the vector method was very effective in meeting the needs of ABCU. While using a vector was the best option for this project, it isn't always the best method. I may soon run into an assignment where a hash table or binary search tree would be a more effective method. Understanding the difference and how to determine when to use each method will be crucial for not only my own development but for implementation when needed in order to deliver the best work that I can. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Initially, I had an issue with understanding run-time analysis. I went over the Zybooks work a few times and was still coming up a little short in understanding. A quick Google search led me to a YouTube video that helped break it down for me in a way that I better understood. While I generally don't have issues learning in any particular method, I do sometimes run into issues where a video makes it easier for me than written text. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I feel that with each class, there is an additional layer of development that gets added to my skill set. While I fully understand that I have not mastered the concepts presented in this class, and I have a long way to go, I feel much better prepared for work in the future. Understanding data structures, even at a basic level, has greatly expanded my views on software development. Not necessarily knowing when to use what method, but at least knowing how to figure out which method you should use, feels like a pretty big step forward on my path to becoming a developer. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I feel like the projects for this course have forced me to change my code into something that is more refined. This refining leaves less bloat. Lack of excess, in my opinion, is always good for software development. The lack of that excess makes the code easier to read and follow. This, in term, makes it more maintainable. Again, I have a long way to go before I can say that I am ready for the real world of development, but I am significantly more confident looking at my work from this class than looking at the work I have previously submitted.
